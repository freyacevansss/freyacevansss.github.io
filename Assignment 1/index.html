    <h3>
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Initially I was drawn to Downstreams interactivity elements, specifically
      that there was a game for the user to play. When searching for the rules
      of the game ‘morton’, I focused on the graphical icon and the box beside
      it as it was flashing alternate questions for the user, prompting my
      participation. This sparked intrigue as to what the game in question was
    </p>

    <h3>
      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Subsequent to spending two minutes immersed in the experience, i've
      compiled a list detailing the intricacies of my actions and observations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the power down button</li>
      <li>Reading the ‘Playtest Report’</li>
      <li>
        Turning the sound on and off, then listening to the audio that occurs
        for disparate buttons
      </li>
      <li>
        Watching the graphical icon alternate and determining if my interactions
        on the website affected which icon was displayed
      </li>
      <li>
        I participated in the gameplay and experimented with a couple of levels
        across varying difficulties, I managed to complete the second and third
        level within the timeframe
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
    <p>Undoubtedly I spent the most time participating with the game and attempting to beat each level. The game involved a pattern shown in graphical icons, then having to remember each icon that was flashed and relay it by clicking each symbol.</p>

    <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
    <p>The most common action completed by me was clicking. This consists of clicking the multitude of buttons. Most rapidly clicking during the game as I repeated each icon back to the site. I found most aspects of the website to be interactive, which resulted in most interaction including clicking. </p>

    <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
    <p>The main purpose of the interactive experience is to involve the user, within the game to establish a sense of fun and playfulness. I believe through this dynamic and jovial interaction that occurs for the user, it is effective in captivating and keeping the user continuously occupied throughout the experience. </p>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
    <p>As the user gets a response with each attempt, the website often replies with witty and playfully spurring sentiments to encourage the user to continue on with the game. This kind of aspect maintains the focus of the user to then instill amusement. </p>
