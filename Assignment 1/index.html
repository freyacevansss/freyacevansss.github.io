    <h2>WEEK 2 PROMPTS</h2>

    <h3>
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Initially I was drawn to Downstreams interactivity elements, specifically
      that there was a game for the user to play. When searching for the rules
      of the game ‘morton’, I focused on the graphical icon and the box beside
      it as it was flashing alternate questions for the user, prompting my
      participation. This sparked intrigue as to what the game in question was
    </p>

    <h3>
      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Subsequent to spending two minutes immersed in the experience, i've
      compiled a list detailing the intricacies of my actions and observations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the power down button</li>
      <li>Reading the ‘Playtest Report’</li>
      <li>
        Turning the sound on and off, then listening to the audio that occurs
        for disparate buttons
      </li>
      <li>
        Watching the graphical icon alternate and determining if my interactions
        on the website affected which icon was displayed
      </li>
      <li>
        I participated in the gameplay and experimented with a couple of levels
        across varying difficulties, I managed to complete the second and third
        level within the timeframe
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
    <p>Undoubtedly I spent the most time participating with the game and attempting to beat each level. The game involved a pattern shown in graphical icons, then having to remember each icon that was flashed and relay it by clicking each symbol.</p>

    <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
    <p>The most common action completed by me was clicking. This consists of clicking the multitude of buttons. Most rapidly clicking during the game as I repeated each icon back to the site. I found most aspects of the website to be interactive, which resulted in most interaction including clicking. </p>

    <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
    <p>The main purpose of the interactive experience is to involve the user, within the game to establish a sense of fun and playfulness. I believe through this dynamic and jovial interaction that occurs for the user, it is effective in captivating and keeping the user continuously occupied throughout the experience. </p>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
    <p>As the user gets a response with each attempt, the website often replies with witty and playfully spurring sentiments to encourage the user to continue on with the game. This kind of aspect maintains the focus of the user to then instill amusement. </p>

    <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? </h3>
    <p>The more I interact with the site, I believe that the main point of interaction is the pattern game. Despite there being external avenues to explore on the site, the game perpetually grabs my attention each time. Whilst I don't believe the website is designed for prolonged engagement for each viewer, it is rather a quick passtime to stimulate user’s boredom for short periods. Although addictive, the game is inclined to induce irritation as a result of incorrect levels, however depending on the user, it may prompt them to disengage or immerse them for continuous periods. </p>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
    <p>The interactive experience communicates its intended interaction pattern over time through the captivating nature of the pattern game. Through exploration, engagement with content, interaction with features and social sharing, downstream allows you to communicate over time. This involves the prompting of continuous exploration of the site with several disparate features to engage with, as well as a particular focus on social sharing over time as there is the opportunity to sign up to the ‘waiting list’ with your email and to join a discord server. </p>

    <h2>WEEK 3 PROMPTS</h2>  

    <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
    <p>Downstream references social media platforms such as discord, through its direct link provided and graphical icon. Media forms such as traditional card and electronic games, audiovisual and interactive media are referenced, including popular games ‘Simon’ and ‘Memory’. These are both pattern recognition games, in the electronic game ‘Simon’, players must repeat the sequence of lights and sounds in the same order, the card game ‘memory’ players flipping over the cards and match the pairs based on your  memory of their positions. </p>

    <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
    <p>It encourages consideration based on interactive engagement, community and engagement, innovation and creativity. Prefacing links and recognisable imagery, resulting in active participation with other platforms, provokes consideration around integrating this. The visual and interactive elements prompt large exploration in my research, with a focus on integral media forms and engagement from users as a result of the website's visual impression. </p>

    <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
    <p>It incites reflection and involvement, urging introspection through interactive participation and community engagement. The significance of innovation and creativity sparks inspiration for my own research experience. There is a priority on influence as that is what drives passion within the research stage, as well as curiosity through exploration that provokes a thorough delve. The website's visual appearance is what leaves a memorable impression with the viewer, therefore careful consideration regarding visual content is crucial. </p>
