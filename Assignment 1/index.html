      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Initially I was drawn to Downstreams interactivity elements, specifically
      that there was a game for the user to play. When searching for the rules
      of the game ‘morton’, I focused on the graphical icon and the box beside
      it as it was flashing alternate questions for the user, prompting my
      participation. This sparked intrigue as to what the game in question was

      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Subsequent to spending two minutes immersed in the experience, i've
      compiled a list detailing the intricacies of my actions and observations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the power down button</li>
      <li>Reading the ‘Playtest Report’</li>
      <li>
        Turning the sound on and off, then listening to the audio that occurs
        for disparate buttons
      </li>
      <li>
        Watching the graphical icon alternate and determining if my interactions
        on the website affected which icon was displayed
      </li>
      <li>
        I participated in the gameplay and experimented with a couple of levels
        across varying difficulties, I managed to complete the second and third
        level within the timeframe
