<!-- Here I made the video loop so that the user can have the visuals continuously 
     play in the background as they study. I used my own art for the video: 
     Infinite Tranquil (2023) Freya Evans. I decided to use my own fractal art visuals
     as fractal art is something that can be quite visually pleasing, but I find it's 
     not too distracting for the user. Paired with Brian Eno's soundtrack it created a 
     calming space-->

            <video id="fractal-art" loop>

<!-- here is the html code for the play-pause button for the media player. This allows
the user to pause/play the video, based on their preference for studying-->

<!-- here is the html code used for the mute/unmute button, this alows the user to mute
the audio if it is too distracting, but they can additionally turn it back on if they 
decide to do so. -->

<!-- here is the html code used for the full screen button - I created a button with 
text so that the user can easily know what to do to enter full screen. This allows the
user to study in fullscreen if they prefer. -->
