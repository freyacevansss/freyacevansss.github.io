    <h1 id="heading">TRACK YOUR STUDY SESSION TODAY!</h1>

    <!-- I was able to use formulate this code using a tutorial from 'Bro Code': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nsb9cjmOVA, 
    I felt a stopwatch/timer would be appropriate to utilise for the study/relaxation
    through research. I found that a timer can help a student study in numerous ways. 
    It can assist in creating a sense of urgency to counteract procrastination which 
    additionally helps prevent burnout through promoting regular breaks. I found that 
    the timer can help the user establish a routine, building discipline and creating 
    productive study habits. A timer can help the user keep track of their study sessions
    and help break them into to more manageable increments. The timer can reduce stress 
    that can be caused by larger tasks, making it easier for the user to just start. 
    Overall, the study timer implements structure, motivation, efficiency and productivity. -->

    <!-- Here is the section for the buttons start/pause/reset on the timer, this gives 
  the user the opportunity to pause their timer if they have a break, and continue the
  timer once they resume, they also have the option to rest, if they want to restart 
  their study session. -->

      <button id="pauseBtn" class="timerBtn">PAUSE</button>
      <button id="resetBtn" class="timerBtn">RESET</button>
    </div>
    <!------------------------------------------------------------------->

    <!-- Here is the ambient sound button section, I included this so that the user has an option 
    to additionally listen to ambient noise as they study, with the option to play/pause the audio 
    if they wish. I gave the user this option as some will study better with sound, and others will 
    prefer silence -->
